```{r}
#I create a separate notebook and download the file again, I do not know what is my mistake but doing this I see that is.na is not working. However, as in the previous notebook =="" WORK well.

rm(list=ls()) 
scores <- read.table("scores_9_14_16.txt",sep="\t",header = TRUE) 
#head(scores)
is.na(scores) #this does NOT work
#scores=="" #this one works OK
```
